[h1]Fixes the built-in speedrun timer, which does not count time properly in some scenarios![/h1]

[h1]Features:[/h1]
[b][list]
    [*]Millisecond display option
    [*]Starve cycle time is counted properly

    [*]Option to display survived (completed) and death (lost) time separately on the select menu
    [*]Option to change the in-game timer's colour
    [*]Option to prevent the in-game timer from fading

    [*]New timer based on physics updates, should compensate for lag so timing is consistent between hardware
