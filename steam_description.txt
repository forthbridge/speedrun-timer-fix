    [*]Option to prevent the in-game timer from fading

    [*]Option between incrementing the timer in Fixed or Free Update
[list]
    [*]Fixed Update runs at 40hz, precision only up to 25ms, but compensates for lag
    [*]Free Update runs at your game's FPS value, can track time much more precisely, but does not account for lag
